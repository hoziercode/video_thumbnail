# video_thumbnail_web

The web implementation of [`video_thumbnail`][1].

## Usage

This package is [endorsed](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin),
which means you can simply use `video_thumbnail` normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do, so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.
